## Greetings üñêÔ∏è

My name is Paulo and I'm an IT student at FATEC Jundia√≠, Brazil. I'm also a former food engineer with R&D and consulting experience, but my interest in technology and programming led me to pursue a new path for my career.
I'm currently studying web development, machine learning, improving my mathematics skills and searching for an internship opportunity!
